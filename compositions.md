#### Accessibility:
I am aware that some of my scores are hard to read, and while I have tried to make things accessible for OCR and screenreaders, this isn't always possible. If you would like a more accessible format of scores (or even just clarification on my terrible handwriting) contact me and I'll do whatever I can.
